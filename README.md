Implemented Hardware-Accelerated AES-128 Cryptographic Core in FPGA using Vivado 

This project implements a high-speed Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-128) encryption engine in Verilog for FPGA, demonstrating 10-round iterative architecture with parallel SubBytes operations, Galois Field arithmetic, and comprehensive NIST-compliant testbenches. The design achieves 100x speedup over software through hardware parallelism, making it suitable for real-time cryptographic applications in banking, secure communications, and data protection systems.
